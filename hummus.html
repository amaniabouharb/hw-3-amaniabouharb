I am so proud of being Lebanese. Not only do we make the best hummus, we also invented it!


<p>

On a side note, I don't know how Americans like hummus, because I've so far failed to find any place that makes it well.

  Eating Hummus is not only good for your soul (because it makes you so darn happy), but it's also great for your body!
Just take a look at the ingredients and their proven benefits!


Hummus is a dip that is made from chickpeas and is probably one of the greatest <em> Lebanese inventions ever!</em>

<p>

There are many proven health benefits to eating hummus.
The ingredients are listed in the table below. All of them have great benefits:


<table>
  <tr><th>Benefit</th>        <th>Verified</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Chickpeas </td>       <td class=trcell>A great source of vegetarian protein and fiber!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Garlic</td>     <td class=trcell>Low in calories, fights sicknesses (hello cold season!), reduces blood pressure, improves cholesterol levels, contains antioxidants that lower your risk of degenerative brain disease... you get the picture!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Seasme Oil </td>  <td class=trcell>Prevents stress, prevents constipation, and promotes bone health!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Olive Oil </td>      <td class=uicell>Lowers your risk of heart disease and is associated with longevity!</td></tr>

</table>

On the right is a picture of a hummus plate served in a deep bowl. That's how we like to serve it in Lebanon.

Sometimes, we serve it with meat -- look at the picture below! Pavlov doesn't need to condition me -- <em> I'm already salivating! </em>

<p> It's simple: Are you on cloud 9? If yes, then it's good hummus. Otherwise, you're probably eating American hummus (aka bad hummus). Sorry! </div>
